# Host_data_on_gEAR
Instructions on preparing the files from different platform(microarray, rnaseq,scRNAseq) for gEAR uploading.

All the scripts are example scripts only, need to be slightly modified based on different datasets, especially for microarray.

We highly recommendated prepare 3 tab delimited files(MUST BE NAMED AS genes.tab, observations.tab,expression.tab) and compress them for gEAR submission, especially for scRNAseq.
