####Prepare uploadint matrix based on cloupe files from cellranger pipeline.

	1.Identify the TSNE/UMAP coordinate from cellranger output (sample_ID/ANALYSIS/20220201_cellranger.6.1.2_6451/sampleID_ILxxxxxxxxx/outs/analysis/), or you can   	export projection in Loupe Broswer version 6.0
	2.Export the cluster name from cloupe by right click the 3 dots on the right top corner of "Graph-Based" window,or from "graphclust" folder
	3.create the observation file with the 1st column named as "observations" and include umap/tsne coordinate. 
	4.also include a column named as "cluster_lable" for primary analsyis
	
####Prepare the expression matrix:

```{r cars}
	pathm1="filtered_feature_bc_matrix/"

	data1 <- Read10X(data.dir = pathm1)
	data1 <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = data1 , project = "patient1",min.cells = 0, min.features = 0)

	count=data.frame(GetAssayData(object = obj))

	ann=read.table("pathm1/features.tsv.gz",sep="\t",header=T)


	count.ann=merge(ann, count,by.y=0,by.x="V2")


	write.table(count.ann[-1],"expression.tab",sep="\t",quote=F,row.names=F)


	write.table(count.ann[c(2,1)],"genes.tab",sep="\t",quote=F,row.names=F)
```
